## Additional Notes

### Issue and Pull Request Labels

This section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

[GitHub search](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues/) makes it easy to use labels for finding groups of issues or pull requests you're interested in.

The labels are loosely grouped by their purpose, but it's not required that every issue have a label from every group or that an issue can't have more than one label from the same group.

Please open an issue if you have suggestions for new labels.

* `bug` - Issues that are bugs.
* `enhancement` - Issues that are feature requests.
* `performance` - Issues or pull requests that address performance issues.
* `refactor` - Issues or pull requests that address code structure.
* `testing` - Issues or pull requests that address testing.
* `work-in-progress` - Pull requests that are still being worked on, more changes will follow.
* `needs-investigation` - Issues that need more information or investigation.
* `blocked` - Issues blocked on other issues.

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Internet 2.0!
