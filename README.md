## Abstract

This whitepaper introduces Forty2.online; an Internet 2.0 initiative, a revolutionary decentralized network designed to create a more equitable and human-centric internet infrastructure. By forking the Cardano blockchain and adapting it to our unique requirements, Internet 2.0 aims to provide a secure, efficient, and inclusive global network. Key features include human verification, node-based service hosting, and a novel economic model incorporating fixed transaction and service taxes.

## 1. Introduction

The internet has become an integral part of modern society, yet it faces challenges in terms of centralization, privacy, and equitable access. Internet 2.0 proposes a paradigm shift in how we conceptualize and interact with the global network infrastructure.

### 1.1 Current Internet Limitations

- Centralization of power and data in the hands of a few large corporations
- Privacy concerns and data breaches
- Unequal access to internet resources and opportunities
- Lack of direct economic incentives for network participants

### 1.2 Internet 2.0 Vision

- Create a truly decentralized network owned and operated by its users
- Ensure privacy and security through advanced cryptographic techniques
- Provide equal opportunities for all participants through a novel economic model
- Foster innovation and collaboration through a decentralized service ecosystem

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Network Foundation

Internet 2.0 is built upon a fork of the Cardano blockchain, chosen for its robust features and alignment with our project goals.

#### 2.1.1 Cardano Foundation Advantages

- Built-in Proof of Stake consensus (Ouroboros)
- Advanced smart contract capabilities
- Designed for scalability and interoperability
- Academic approach with peer-reviewed research

#### 2.1.2 Key Modifications

- Implementation of human verification layer
- Adaptation of the reward system for our unique salary structure
- Development of a service hosting framework
- Integration of our dual-tax system

### 2.2 Consensus Mechanism

Internet 2.0 leverages Cardano's Ouroboros Proof of Stake protocol, with modifications to suit our specific needs.

#### 2.2.1 Proof of Stake Implementation

- Adaptation of Ouroboros protocol for Internet 2.0 requirements
- Integration with human verification for validator selection
- Custom stake slashing mechanisms for misbehaving nodes

#### 2.2.2 Energy Efficiency

- Inherited benefits of Cardano's energy-efficient design
- Further optimizations for Internet 2.0 specific operations

### 2.3 Node Structure

Each node in the Internet 2.0 network represents a verified human participant. Nodes can:

- Validate transactions
- Participate in consensus
- Host services
- Earn rewards

#### 2.3.1 Node Types

- Full nodes: Store complete blockchain, participate in consensus
- Light nodes: Store partial blockchain, suitable for mobile devices
- Service nodes: Specialized nodes for hosting decentralized services

#### 2.3.2 Node Requirements

- Minimum hardware specifications
- Staking requirements for different node types
- Human verification prerequisites

## 3. Key Features

### 3.1 Human Verification

To ensure one-node-per-human and maintain network integrity, each node must be associated with a verified human user.

#### 3.1.1 Verification Method

- Fingerprint capture via Mobile App
- Multi-factor authentication options (e.g., government ID, biometrics)
- Periodic re-verification requirements

#### 3.1.2 Privacy Considerations

- Implementation of zero-knowledge proofs to protect user data
- Decentralized identity (DID) integration
- Data minimization principles in verification process

### 3.2 Node Rewards

Nodes receive a fixed salary based on their participation in the network.

#### 3.2.1 Salary Determination

- Algorithm based on the node operator's date of birth
- Considerations for fairness and preventing age discrimination
- Potential for additional factors (e.g., network contribution, uptime)

#### 3.2.2 Distribution Mechanism

- Regular intervals (e.g., daily or weekly payouts)
- Smart contract-based automatic distributions
- Options for reinvestment or compounding of rewards

### 3.3 Service Hosting

Nodes can host various services, creating a decentralized application ecosystem.

#### 3.3.1 Service Types

- Web hosting
- Decentralized storage solutions
- Computation and AI services
- Communication protocols (e.g., messaging, video streaming)

#### 3.3.2 Quality of Service

- Implementation of reputation systems
- Service level agreements (SLAs) and enforcement mechanisms
- Redundancy and load balancing across multiple nodes

### 3.4 Economic Model

A dual-tax system is implemented to sustain the network and incentivize participation.

#### 3.4.1 Transaction Tax

- Fixed 10% on all network transactions
- Allocation of collected taxes (e.g., node rewards, development fund)
- Potential for dynamic adjustment based on network health

#### 3.4.2 Service Tax

- Maximum 10% charged by service providers
- Mechanisms to prevent tax evasion
- Incentives for competitive pricing

## 4. Blockchain Foundation: Bitcoin vs. Cardano

### 4.1 Comparison of Bitcoin and Cardano

#### 4.1.1 Bitcoin

Pros:
- Longest-running and most battle-tested blockchain
- High security and resistance to attacks
- Large and active developer community
- Strong brand recognition

Cons:
- Limited smart contract functionality
- Energy-intensive Proof of Work consensus
- Scalability challenges
- Less flexible for implementing complex features

#### 4.1.2 Cardano

Pros:
- Built-in Proof of Stake consensus (Ouroboros)
- Advanced smart contract capabilities
- Designed for scalability and interoperability
- Academic approach with peer-reviewed research
- Native multi-asset support

Cons:
- Younger platform with less real-world stress testing
- Smaller developer community compared to Bitcoin
- More complex architecture

### 4.2 Decision to Fork Cardano

After careful consideration, we have decided to fork Cardano as the foundation for Internet 2.0. The key factors influencing this decision are:

1. **Proof of Stake Alignment**: Cardano's Ouroboros Proof of Stake protocol aligns closely with our goals for energy efficiency and democratic participation.

2. **Smart Contract Capabilities**: Cardano's robust smart contract platform provides the flexibility we need to implement complex features.

3. **Scalability and Interoperability**: Cardano's design principles are crucial for our vision of a global, decentralized internet infrastructure.

4. **Scientific Approach**: The peer-reviewed, academic approach of Cardano provides a solid foundation for building a secure and well-thought-out system.

5. **Native Multi-Asset Support**: This feature aligns well with our plans for a diverse ecosystem of services and applications on Internet 2.0.

### 4.3 Modifications to Cardano

Several modifications will be necessary to realize the full vision of Internet 2.0:

1. **Human Verification Layer**: Implementing our unique human verification system.
2. **Custom Reward Mechanism**: Adapting the reward system to incorporate our date-of-birth based salary structure.
3. **Service Hosting Framework**: Developing a framework for decentralized service hosting.
4. **Tax System Implementation**: Implementing our dual-tax system within the network's economic model.
5. **Governance Adaptations**: Modifying Cardano's governance model to fit the specific needs and goals of Internet 2.0.

### 4.4 Challenges and Mitigations

1. **Complexity**: We will invest in comprehensive documentation and developer tools to ease the learning curve.
2. **Nascent Ecosystem**: We plan to actively foster community growth and provide incentives for developers.
3. **Ongoing Development**: We'll carefully manage our fork to potentially incorporate beneficial upstream changes while maintaining our unique features.
